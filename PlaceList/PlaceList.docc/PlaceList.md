# ``PlaceList``

Feature module for the PlaceList related classes and logic

## Overview

This is a "Vertical" module which contains all the logic related to showing places on a list. 
As more features are added to an app new "Vertical" modules can be added. 
This improves cohesion of logic, since creates some communication boundaries that are more difficult to cross by miskate, and if it's needed modules can be developed and run independently.
